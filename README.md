# Backend Challenge: Document Q&A System

## Overview
Build a production-ready system that enables users to query documents of any size and receive accurate, contextually relevant answers. Your solution should demonstrate strong engineering practices and handle documents that exceed typical LLM context windows.

## The Challenge
Implement an endpoint that allows users to query document content effectively. Focus on building a robust, production-ready solution that demonstrates your engineering judgment.

## Current Implementation
- Basic Express server setup
- Endpoint structure 
- Test documents in `src/documents/`

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Create `.env` file with required API keys

3. Run development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Test Documents
The `src/documents/` folder contains sample documents for validating your implementation. Your solution should handle these effectively while maintaining performance and reliability.

Focus on demonstrating your ability to build reliable, production-ready systems. Show us how you think about engineering challenges and make technical decisions.
